# 🧑‍💻 GitHub User Finder

This is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It lets users search for any GitHub username and displays their profile info along with their top 10 repositories.

It is **My First Online Hackathon Project** from **CodeSprout HACKATHON**

## 🔍 What It Does  
- Search GitHub users by username  
- Show profile picture, name, bio, followers, and following  
- List top 10 repositories

## 🛠️ How I Built It  
I used vanilla JavaScript to fetch data from the GitHub API and dynamically update the webpage. HTML and CSS were used for the structure and styling, focusing on a clean and responsive design.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges I Ran Into  
Making the design responsive on different screen sizes was tricky. Handling API errors and loading states also took some trial and error.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments I'm Proud Of  
Improving my CSS skills to build a clean UI and learning how to work with external APIs using JavaScript fetch.

---

## 📚 What I Learned  
How to fetch and handle data from an API, update the DOM dynamically, and deploy a simple frontend app using GitHub Pages.

## 🌟 What’s Next  
- Add more detailed repository info like stars and forks
